# Game Pillars and Theme

## Core Concept
Pokemon meets Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon through cooking. You inherit your eccentric Great-Aunt Cordelia's quirky restaurant and overgrown garden after she mysteriously disappears, leaving only a cryptic note about "settling an old debt." Master her unconventional Munchie-care methods, restore her farm-to-table empire, and follow recipe clues to discover her fate.

## Pillars
- Battle and Bond: Turn-based battles, creature growth, and long-term bonding with your Munchies.
- Crafting as Cooking: Recipes are the primary progression engine. Cooking creates food, tools, items, and Munchies.
- Cozy Community: NPC relationships, gifting, quests, and town life drive the heart of the experience.
- Restoration and Ownership: Rebuild the restaurant and garden into a thriving local destination.
- Mystery and Discovery: Cordelia's trail unfolds through recipes, locations, and social clues.

## Player Loop
Explore -> Battle -> Collect -> Craft or Cook -> Social and Progress -> Repeat

## Setting and Tone
- Location: Cast Iron Cove, a cozy coastal valley with a "flavor leyline" that amplifies the bond between ingredients and emotion.
- Story hook: Cordelia vanished three months ago with her favorite Munchie team, leaving behind cryptic recipes and growing techniques.
- Vibe: Northern California coastal energy, quirky and artsy with a touch of mystery.

## Inspirations and Visual Direction
- Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon for cozy farming, town life, and relationships.
- Pokemon for creature battles, bonding, and collecting.
- Low poly and kawaii for a friendly, readable, stylized look.

## Terminology
- Munchies: Player-facing name for creatures. Code and data use "creature" and "creature_id".
- Cooking: Implemented via the crafting system with recipe resources and stations.

## Current Build Alignment
- 21 Munchies, 6 encounter zones, 58 recipes, 16 ingredients.
- Battle system, crafting stations, farming, NPC dialogue and gifting, quests, shops, and restaurant interiors are implemented.
- Customer service loop, festivals, and expanded town simulation are planned but not yet built.
