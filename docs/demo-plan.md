## Core Concept
Pokemon meets Stardew Valley through cooking. You inherit your eccentric Great-Aunt Cordelia's quirky restaurant and overgrown garden after she mysteriously disappears, leaving only a cryptic note about "settling an old debt." Master her unconventional Munchie-care methods, restore her farm-to-table empire, and follow recipe clues to discover her fate.

## What We Have Established

### Setting
- Cast Iron Cove: A cozy, coastal valley once known for rich soils, vibrant ingredients, and culinary tourism.
- You inherit Aunt Cordelia's restaurant (known locally as "that weird place") and a neglected garden.
- Cordelia vanished three months ago with her favorite Munchie team.
- Restaurant needs restoration, garden needs clearing and replanting.

### Aunt Cordelia's Legacy
- World-renowned chef who treated her cooked Munchies like beloved pets.
- Locals saw her as eccentric, but admitted her food was incredible.
- Her methods worked: pampered Munchies were unusually strong and loyal.
- Left behind cryptic recipes and growing techniques.

### Cast Iron Cove Details
- The magic: Built on a "flavor leyline" that enhances the bond between ingredients and emotion.
- The community: Faded seaside tourist town, now quieter with farmers, fisherfolk, and retired chefs.
- The vibe: Northern California coastal energy, quirky and artsy with a touch of mystery.
- Munchie culture: Locals always lived alongside Munchies, but Cordelia's "pet care" methods were seen as extreme.

### Your Restaurant
- Location: Edge of town, near cliffs and beach, scenic but isolated.
- Condition: Functional but neglected, kitchen barely works, garden overgrown.
- Architecture: Converted coastal greenhouse with big windows, rusted wrought iron arches, sea-worn wooden beams.
